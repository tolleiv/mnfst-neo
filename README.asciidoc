This tool will soon provide some way to get an impact score for file changes in Puppet repositories. It will eventually not even be Puppet related. We'll see.

For now it's just a proof of concept.


## Usage


     # Import the files which are contained in the servers catalog:
     curl -X PUT -H 'Content-Type:text/plain' -d "@./filelist.txt" http://localhost:3000/server/server.example.org

     # Get the score for a server
     curl -X GET -H 'Content-Type:text/plain' -d "@./filelist.txt" http://localhost:3000/files/score

     # Set the weight of a server
     curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -d "{weight:10}" http://localhost:3000/server/server.example.org

     # Cleanup all file relations of a server
     curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/server/server.example.org/files

     # Remove a server
     curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/server/server.example.org

     # Remove a list of files
     curl -X DELETE -H 'Content-Type:text/plain' -d "@./filelist.txt" http://localhost:3000/files

## Data formats

### Content-type: text/plain

The filelist should just be a plaintext list of server names / fqdns delimited by newlines (\n).

     server1.example.org
     server2.example.org

### Content-type: application/json

The filelist should just be an array of server names / fqdns.

    ['server1.example.org','server2.example.org']
