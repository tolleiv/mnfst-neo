This tool will soon provide some way to get an impact score for file changes in Puppet repositories. It will eventually not even be Puppet related. We'll see.

For now it's just a proof of concept.


## Usage


     # Import the files which are contained in the servers catalog:
     curl -X PUT -H 'Content-Type:text/plain' -d "@./filelist.txt" http://localhost:3000/server/server.example.org

     # Cleanup all relations of a server
     curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/server/server.example.org/

     #Get the score for a server
     curl -X GET -H 'Content-Type:text/plain' -d "@./filelist.txt" http://localhost:3000/files/score

     #Set the weight of a server
     curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -d "{weight:10}" http://localhost:3000/server/server.example.org
